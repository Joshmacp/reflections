When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would want a remote repository so its easy and simply for my team to push and pull copies of the project. Having a remote storage solution is also useful because there is much less a chance everything could get lost.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	I might want to view changes before I decide to pull them into my copy.  There could also be multiple branches to consider.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	I would fork when I want to modify someone elses project and have my own custom working copy. I would clone when I just want to look at how something works, but I wont be using the code for anything. I would use a branch in a team/collab environment or when I want to test new features in my own project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	I can track changes against that copy offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	I would drag and drop files, or zip transfer through email. It would be a serious time suck compared with the version control systems. Obviously git is the easiest thing to use, and github makes it even easier by having a nice layout.
