What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Initializing the repository adds the git file systems to the folder. This project can now be tracked and manipulated using git. We need to do this to start using our version control system.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is different because we may wish that not all our local files are added to the repository. The value in having a staging area is that we can test changes we've made before we commit them to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	I can use git status to check which files have been modified. I can then see exactly which lines of code were changed so changes are more easily found in the code.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	Branches would be helpful for multiple versions of the same thing. For example, different language versions of a website or different difficulties for a game. I could also slightly modify a branch from the master for A/B testing. Branches help by keeping changes organized while always having a consistent main branch to go back to.
