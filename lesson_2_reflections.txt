What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Initializing the repository adds the git file systems to the folder. This project can now be tracked and manipulated using git. We need to do this to start using our version control system.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is different because we may wish that not all our local files are added to the repository. The value in having a staging area is that we can test changes we've made before we commit them to the repository.
